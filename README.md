# winapp2.ini

This repository contains a (partial) history of the Winapp2.ini file as maintained at www.winapp2.com (called "upstream" here) as well as some of the removed entries, which are now added back in for use in BleachBit.

## Files

* Winapp2.ini: the unmodified file from upstream
* removed-entries.ini: entries removed frm upstream that are added back for BleachBit

## Reporting bugs
For bugs in the unmodified Winapp2.ini file or to report a change that belongs upstream (which benefits BlachBit, CCleaner, and System Ninja), please use the contact information in Winapp2.ini itself or visit www.winapp2.com

For bugs in the extra entries or to report an entry removed from www.winapp2.com that belongs in BleachBit, please file a bug report at https://bugs.launchpad.net/bleachbit/ .
