# winapp2.ini

This repository contained a (partial) history of the Winapp2.ini file as maintained at www.winapp2.com (called "upstream" here) plus some of the removed entries, which were added back in for use in [BleachBit](https://www.bleachbit.org). Now the development of the upstream file moved to its own GitHub repository, so new history is tracked there.

## Files

* [Winapp2.ini](https://github.com/bleachbit/winapp2.ini/blob/master/Winapp2.ini): the unmodified file from upstream with entries removed for CCleaner added back
* [check_ini.py]: Sanity checks for Winapp2.ini
* [merge-commit.sh]: Processing and sanity checks for Winapp2.ini

## Reporting bugs
For bugs in the unmodified Winapp2.ini file or to report a change that belongs upstream (which benefits BleachBit, CCleaner, System Ninja, and Avira System Speedup), please see the [Winapp2 GitHub page](https://github.com/MoscaDotTo/Winapp2/).

For issues with the Winapp2.ini as it relates specifically to BleachBit, please file a [bug report at this repository](https://github.com/bleachbit/winapp2.ini/issues). If the issue is with the BleachBit application (for example, how it interprets the Winapp2.ini), file the issue in the [BleachBit application repository](https://github.com/az0/bleachbit/).
