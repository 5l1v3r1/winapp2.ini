# winapp2.ini

This repository contains a (partial) history of the Winapp2.ini file as maintained at www.winapp2.com (called "upstream" here) plus some of the removed entries, which are now added back in for use in [BleachBit](http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net).

## Files

* [Winapp2.ini](https://github.com/az0/winapp2.ini/blob/master/Winapp2.ini): the unmodified file from upstream
* [removed-entries.ini](https://github.com/az0/winapp2.ini/blob/master/removed-entries.ini): entries removed from upstream that are added back for BleachBit
* [Winapp2-combined.ini](https://github.com/az0/winapp2.ini/blob/master/Winapp2-combined.ini): simply Winapp2.ini plus removed-entries.ini for use in BleachBit

## Reporting bugs
For bugs in the unmodified Winapp2.ini file or to report a change that belongs upstream (which benefits BleachBit, CCleaner, and System Ninja), please use the contact information in the Winapp2.ini file itself or visit www.winapp2.com

For bugs in the extra entries or to report an entry removed from www.winapp2.com that belongs in BleachBit, please file a bug report at https://bugs.launchpad.net/bleachbit/ .
